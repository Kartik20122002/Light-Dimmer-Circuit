## Electric Light Dimmer circuit using SCR or TRIAC

Light dimmer circuit is used to control the voltage which gets to the light. This circuit has been possible for many decades by using variable transformers and resistors.
These methods have been used in public places like theaters and stage lighting, homes, conference halls, restaurants, etc. But, light controlling methods are inexpensive,
big and efficiency is less and they are very hard to control for the remote areas.

Modern light dimmers work by changing the duty cycle of the AC voltage which is applied to the lights being controlled. For instance, if the voltage is applied to half of the AC cycle
then the light bulb will appear with less intensity when it gets the full AC voltage. Because it gets the low power to heat the filament. These light dimmers use the brightness knob to
control at what point each cycle to switch the light ON and OFF.
